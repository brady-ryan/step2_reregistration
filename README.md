# Improvement of SEA Re-Registration Step 2 Brightspace Grades

The codes in this repo allow us to quicken Step 2 of re-reg through automatically updating quiz grades in a few steps.

1) $\textbf{Get Quiz Grades:}$ in Brightspace, navigate to ```Grades --> Export```, select the ```Org Defined ID, Points grade, 25-26 Re-Registration Quiz(1)``` bullets in the list, then select ```Export to CSV (For Importing)``` to download the .csv file.
2) $\textbf{Sort Passing Grades:}$ Firstly, upload the downloaded csv file to your Google Drive. Next, copy the code from ```sort_brightspace_grades.ipynb``` to a new $\text{Google Colab}$ notebook within the same folder as the csv file, and fill in the user-specific information. Running this code will generate a new .txt file, ```passers.txt```, that contains a list of the SBU ID numbers of all students who have passed the quiz.
3) $\textbf{Import Passers and Highlights}$: go to the Google Sheet containing the Re-Reg Tracker information. Navigate to the ```Name/Position Reference Sheet```, fully highlight column F by clicking on it, then go to ```File --> Import --> passers.txt --> Replace data at selected cell, Detect automatically --> Import data``` to import the ID numbers. Next, go to ```Extensions --> Apps Script``` and copy ```highlight_passers.js``` into a new script. Save and click ```Run```. You should now see all passing ID numbers highlighted in yellow in column E.
4) $\textbf{Mark Quiz Complete in Tracker}$: go back to ```Extensions --> Apps Script``` and copy ```mark_complete.js``` to a new file. Run this code to automatically check off Quiz Complete or Quiz & Form Complete in the ```Step 2: Tracker``` file.
